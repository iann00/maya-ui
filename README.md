# MayaUI

MayaUI is my effort to create components that are responsive and at the same time look good on smaller devices like smartphones.

Considering that there are already libs with responsive components, what is the meaning of Maya? Give greater degree of customization! Lib was designed to have a greater degree of customization such as rounded corners, shadows and smooth transitions.

While other libs focus on styling basic HTML components, Maya is concerned with providing components such as avatar upload, banner upload and, for convenience, the simple upload button.

With this proposal, here at Navi Dev, we were able to create components for the web that resemble the components we use on Android, in this case, the avatar upload as exemplified.

## Project setup

To configure MayaUI, you need to install NodeJS. Then open Node and run
```
npm install --save maya-ui
```
This command will install the package and update the new dependence in dependency
in all necessary places

### Contributing

The easy mode to do this is 

1. Go to maya-ui/dist/style.scss and copy the file to another folder
2. Open the NodeJS and run ```npm install -g node-sass```
3. Set the values to all variables in style.scss
4. In the same style.scss's folder ```node-sass style.scss maya-ui.css```
5. Replace the file maya-ui.css in maya-ui/dist/maya-ui.css by new file generated
6. Good job! You customized the MayaUI
